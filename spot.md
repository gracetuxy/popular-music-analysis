### Part 2 Popular Artist Writeup

Describe and justify your choice of measurement for popularity. 

The given function is a fairly good measurement for popularity but it does not account for each song's numerical rank. Perhaps a better definition for most popular artists would be the artists with the highest/smallest average rank for artists with at least 2 songs in the top 100s. 
Justification: artists with at least 2 songs in the top 100s would have be fairly popular instead of just have 1 lucky hit song. Within those artists, finding the average rank of those songs can give a better ideas of how popular or how high up they are on the chart.

### Part 3 Data visualization Writeup

#### 3.1 interpretation:

Give an interpretation of the plot from Part 3.1

The plot shows that the 'rap' genre generally has high danceability and high speechiness compare to non-rap genres.
I think their measure of speechiness is reasonable since the speech in rap songs is generally faster than many other genres, but the danceability measure is quite abstract as any genre or song is arguably danceable. The plot seems to suggest that spotify consider rap songs very danceable, perhaps because of its faster beat.

#### 3.2

Write a paragraph or so describing what you have found in your own exploration. 

I explored the question: which genre is most similar to pop in terms in speechiness and energy?
I'm asking this because I like pop songs since it's has many words to sing along (med-high speechiness) to and is high energy, so to find another genre I may potentially like, I can use a scatter plot to discover which genres overlap the most with pop in terms of its speechiness and energy.
After plotting all the given genres with pop, I found that the 'dance' genre has the most overlap with 'pop'. In fact, every dance song in the top100s is also a pop song, though not all pop songs are dance songs. 'country' songs and 'rap' songs also have a bit of overlap with 'pop' song, but 'country' is generally less speechy, while 'rap' has a higher concentration of speechy and high energy songs. Thus, 'dance' songs would be the best bet in terms of similarity, followed by 'rap'.
