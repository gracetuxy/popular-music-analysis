# Project 1 -- Billboard 
- Use pandas data frames as a fundamental structure
- Filter, project, reassemble data frames to extract information
- Report and visualize information using a variety of plots

This project uses Spotify Web API, dataclasses in the `models.py` file, and the Billboard Hot 100 list to analyze characteristics of popular music. 

We start by quering spotify and assembling a list of songs ('Track'), then we use the Billboard Hot 100 list to determine the most popular artist of the week by measuring
the number of tracks that an artist has on the list and lastly, we visualized how audio features of songs are related to the genre.
